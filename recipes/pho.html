    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Many people get hooked on Vietnamese food after trying pho — a heady bowl of spiced broth with flat, tangly rice noodles, a featured protein topping of your choice, green onions, and herbs. Each pho cook has their own formula for seasoning and crafting the broth and toppings.</p>
    <p>Diners get to personalize their pho noodle soup at the table by adding various kinds of condiments, herbs, and sometimes bean sprouts too. It’s a quintessential have-it-your-way dish. Beef pho (pho bo) is most common but there are many kinds of pho. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bones and Tough Beef Cuts</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Rice Noodles:</strong> These are similar to the ones used for pad Thai. They may be labeled banh pho at the supermarket or Asian grocer. Dried banh pho last a long time in the cupboard.</li>
        <li><strong>Aromatics</strong>Ginger, onion (or shallot) lend sweet-spicy zip and a little pungent note too.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices</strong>The spicing varies from cook to cook. For beef pho, there is typically star anise, cinnamon/cassia sticks, and clove. Here, Lett101 adds peppercorns for a pungent note. Regardless, make sure you use star anise with robust points so your broth gets lots of its savor. Each star anise has 8 points. It is okay to use broken ones.</li>
        <li><strong>Daikon</strong>Adding daikon naturally adds earthy sweetness to the broth. Substitute turnip if you like.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt, sugar, and fish sauce:</strong>These are the foundational pho seasonings. For the sugar, Chinese yellow rock sugar is often used for southern Vietnamese-style pho broth; if you don’t have it, use granulated sugar (organic has a deeper flavor than white granulated sugar). A sweetener helps to round out pho broth flavor. Fish sauce, sold at many supermarkets and Asian markets, adds umami savoriness to the broth. </li>
        <li><strong>Steak</strong>Choose a tender cut of steak. Splurge on marbled meat and slice it thin so it will be cooked quickly by the hot broth. If you do not like raw-ish meat, omit it and focus on the cooked beef!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Make broth: Place beef bones in a 9-quart (or larger) pot; season with 1 teaspoon salt. Pour water into the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer broth for about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a 10x15-inch roasting pan with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Place onions and unpeeled ginger onto the prepared roasting pan and cook under the preheated broiler, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are charred, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool slightly. Chop onions, then peel and slice ginger; set aside separately.</li>
        <li>Skim fat from surface of simmering broth. Add oxtail, radish, and charred onions to broth. Tie charred ginger, anise, cinnamon stick, peppercorns, and cloves in cheesecloth to make a bouquet garni; add to broth. Stir in sugar, fish sauce, and remaining 2 teaspoons salt. Simmer over medium-low heat for at least 4 hours (the longer, the better). Season with salt. </li>
        <li>Strain broth. Discard bones and bouquet garni. Reserve meat from bones for another use. Chill broth in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Skim and discard fat from the top of chilled broth. Pour broth into a pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and keep hot until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Turn off heat. Stir in rice noodles and let sit until noodles are tender yet chewy, 6 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cut frozen sirloin into paper-thin slices.</li>
        <li>Drain and divide noodles among bowls, about 1 1/2 cups per serving. Top each with a few sirloin slices. Ladle hot broth over sirloin and noodles.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
